Zemplate is a bare-bones WordPress theme to act as a
starting point for theme devleopers.

Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic
markup, Zemplate is the perfect 'blank slate' for
your WordPress projects.

Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed,
so you can use it for whatever you like â€” even
your commercial projects.

For more information on the company that maintains
Zemplate, see the Zenman website:
